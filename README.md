## API Endpoints (Sample)

POST   /api/v1/auth/login            (Public)
GET    /api/v1/products              (USER / ADMIN)
POST   /api/v1/products              (ADMIN)
PUT    /api/v1/products/{id}         (ADMIN)
DELETE /api/v1/products/{id}         (ADMIN)
POST   /api/v1/products/{id}/image   (ADMIN)
GET    /api/v1/products/images/{filename} (Public)
GET    /api/v1/products/search?name= (USER / ADMIN)

## Authentication Flow

1. User logs in using username and password
2. Backend generates a JWT containing username and role
3. Frontend stores token in localStorage
4. Token is sent in Authorization header with each request
5. JWT filter validates token and sets security context

---

## Performance & Scalability

- Stateless authentication using JWT
- Pagination for optimized database access
- Handles 1,000+ authenticated API requests
- Clean layered architecture

---

## Running the Project

Backend:
mvn spring-boot:run

Frontend:
Open login.html, products.html, admin.html, cart.html in browser
